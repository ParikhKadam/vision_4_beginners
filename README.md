# Computer Vision for Beginners
*: The series of Computer Vision for Beginners*

Computer Vision is one of the hottest topics in artificial intelligence. It is making tremendous advances in self-driving cars, robotics as well as in various photo correction apps. Steady progress in object detection is being made every day. GANs is also a thing researchers are putting their eyes on these days. Vision is showing us the future of technology and we canâ€™t even imagine what will be the end of its possibilities.

## Installing OpenCV

The installation can be processed as follows:

```
pip install opencv-python==3.4.2
pip install opencv-contrib-python==3.3.1
```

After you finish the installation, try importing the package to see if it works well

```
import cv2
cv2.__version__
```

you can also find the detailed description [here](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)
