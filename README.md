# Computer Vision for Beginners
*: The series of Computer Vision for Beginners on Medium*

Computer Vision is one of the hottest topics in artificial intelligence. It is making tremendous advances in self-driving cars, robotics as well as in various photo correction apps. Steady progress in object detection is being made every day. GANs is also a thing researchers are putting their eyes on these days. Vision is showing us the future of technology and we canâ€™t even imagine what will be the end of its possibilities.
